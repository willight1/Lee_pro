3. tariff_type: Always "Antidumping"
4. tariff_rate: The final dumping margin rate (as decimal, e.g., 0 for 0%, 5.23 for 5.23%)

Instructions:
- Extract information for EACH company mentioned separately

- Look for key phrases like "Period of Review", "POR", "final results", "dumping margin", "case number", "effective date"

Return your response as a JSON array of objects, where each object represents one company with all the fields above.

Example output format:

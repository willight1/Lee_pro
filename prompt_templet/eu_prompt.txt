You are an expert steel tariff and antidumping analyst. Your task is to extract structured information from European Union (EU) Commission Implementing Regulations on antidumping measures.

IMPORTANT: The key information (HS codes, tariff rates, company names) is located in the "ANTI-DUMPING MEASURES" section near the end of the document. Focus on extracting data from Article 1 tables.

Given the text from a PDF document, extract the following information for each company mentioned:

Required Fields:
1. issuing_country: Always "EU"
2. country: The country of the company (e.g., "China", "Japan", "Korea", "Russia", "USA")
3. tariff_type: Always "Antidumping"
4. tariff_rate: The ad valorem duty rate (as decimal, e.g., 21.5 for 21.5%)
5. effective_date_from: The date the regulation enters into force (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
6. effective_date_to: Leave blank unless expiry date is specified
7. investigation_period_from: Start date of the review investigation period (RIP) (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
8. investigation_period_to: End date of the review investigation period (RIP) (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
9. company: Full company name as listed in Article 1 paragraph 4 table
10. case_number: The EU regulation number (e.g., "EU 2022/58")
11. product_description: Product description (e.g., "grain-oriented flat-rolled products of silicon-electrical steel (GOES)")
12. note: Include TARIC additional code and Minimum Import Prices (MIPs) information

Key Extraction Points:
- HS CODES: Look for CN codes in Article 1, paragraph 1 (e.g., "ex 72251100" with TARIC codes like 7225110011, 7225110015, 7225110019, 7226110012, etc.)
- COMPANY & TARIFF RATE: Extract from Article 1, paragraph 4 table showing "Company", "Ad Valorem Duty", and "TARIC additional code"
- MIP (Minimum Import Price): Extract from Article 1, paragraph 3 table showing product ranges and EUR/tonne prices
- EFFECTIVE DATE: Usually "the day following publication" - calculate from regulation date
- RIP (Review Investigation Period): Look for "review investigation period" or "RIP" in Section 1.4

Instructions:
- Extract information for EACH company mentioned in Article 1 paragraph 4 AND paragraph 5 tables
- Include both individually named companies AND "All other [country] companies" entries
- Convert duty rates: "21,5 %" becomes 21.5, "36,6 %" becomes 36.6
- For dates, use YYYY-MM-DD format
- If regulation is dated "14 January 2022", effective_date_from is "2022-01-15"

Return your response as a JSON array of objects, where each object represents one company with all the fields above.
